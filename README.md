## Projects

### Customer Segmentation for an E-learning platform
* Data Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Customer Segmentation using unsupervised ML
  - Data Standardization
  - Optimal number of clusters : The Elbow method, Silhouette Score and Gap Statistics

### Customer Churn Analysis with SQL and Tableau
This project was executed on 365DataScience platform data. In this project i practiced MySQL to load, preprocess data, and apply SQL Queries to get insights from the data.
Next, i made beautiful dashboards on Tableau. This included loading data on Tableau, defining filters and KPIs, and finally building visualizations by choosing appropriate charts (Bar Chart, Bubble Chart, Line Chart, etc.).
I also practiced Cohort Analysis Table, Maps and Order Frequency Table.

### Change Count with Computer Vision
Used OpenCV, Canny's algorithm and Hough Circle Transform to detect the value of coins in a picture and count the change.

### Time Series Forecasting
Case study on S&P500 (in progress)

### Real Estate Market Analysis with Python
* Data Wrangling (Preprocessing)
* Data Exploratory Data Analysis
* Visualization

### IOT : Smart PPG Device
During my final year of study I had the opportunity to build a smart PPG device from scratch that measures a patient's physiological parameters such as BPM, SpO2, and body temperature. The device sends the patient's parameters via Bluetooth to a mobile Android app developed in Kotlin, data is then displayed on the app's user interface and it is stored in Firebase's Realtime Database (NoSQL).
As this type of devices already exist in the market, the innovation part was to add a haptic sollicitation used to finally measure the patient's level of stress using the cardiac response (shape of the waveform) to this sollicitation.


## Work Experience

### Data Analyst & assistant to project manager
* Developed a custom tool to Extract, Transform and Load data from PDF documents: used Python and Flask, tested the app with OpenAI API, and finally deployed it on AWS EC2.
* Participated in the design and testing of an automatic intrusion detection solution using computer vision with the YOLO v8 model.
* Contributed to the configuration and testing of the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for RESTful APIs.
* Conducted functional testing on AppVision for the supervision of stations and premises.
* Developed interactive dashboards using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX.

### Data Management intern
* Developed a requirements management tool based on Machine learning and NLP.
* Automated the department's process of extracting and loading data from different sources using VBA and Regular Expressions.
* Defined KPIs and built visualizations and dashboards on Power BI.
* Established a standardized process for requirement management using the developed tools, and communicated this streamlined process across various departments for global implementation.

### Robotics automation intern
During this internship i contributed to the development (from scratch) of a collaborative robot.
My primary responsibilities included:
* 3D Modeling and Simulation:
Conducted 3D modeling and simulation of a 6-axis robot arm using Matlab, laying the groundwork for the project.
* Real-Time Programming with ROS and Gazebo:
Engaged in real-time programming and simulation of the robot's modules using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Gazebo, enhancing its operational capabilities.
* Linux Environment Performance Testing:
Executed performance testing automation in a Linux environment, ensuring the robustness and efficiency of the collaborative robot.
