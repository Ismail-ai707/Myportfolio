#### Customer Churn Analysis with SQL and Tableau
This project was executed on 365DataScience platform data. In this project i used MySQL (and pgAdmin) to load, preprocess data, and apply SQL Queries to get insights from the data.
Next, i made beautiful dashboards on Tableau. This included loading data on Tableau, defining filters and KPIs, and finally building visualizations by choosing appropriate charts (Bar Chart, Bubble Chart, Line Chart, etc.).
I also practiced Cohort Analysis Table, Maps and Order Frequency Table.

#### Real Estate Market Analysis with Python
* Data Wrangling (Preprocessing)
* Data Exploratory Data Analysis
* Visualization

### Work Experience

#### Data Analyst
Currently in this role, I am working as data analyst for the company's executive management team and I support the project manager in different tasks mainly focused on managing and analyzing data.
* Extracting, Transformating and Loading data for analysis on Excel.
* Performing data analysis and defining KPIs.
* Building visualizations and dashboards on Power BI for decision-making.

#### Data Management intern
* Developed a requirements management tool based on Machine learning and NLP.
* Automated the department's process of extracting and loading data from different sources using Regular Expressions.
* Defined KPIs and built visualizations and dashboards on Power BI.
* Established a standardized process for requirement management using the developed tools, and communicated this streamlined process across various departments for global implementation.

#### Robotics automation intern
During this internship i contributed to the development (from scratch) of a collaborative robot.
My primary responsibilities included:
* 3D Modeling and Simulation:
Conducted 3D modeling and simulation of a 6-axis robot arm using Matlab, laying the groundwork for the project.
* Real-Time Programming with ROS and Gazebo:
Engaged in real-time programming and simulation of the robot's modules using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Gazebo, enhancing its operational capabilities.
* Linux Environment Performance Testing:
Executed performance testing automation in a Linux environment, ensuring the robustness and efficiency of the collaborative robot.
